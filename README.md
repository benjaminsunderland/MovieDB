##  What did I like / What would I like to include in the future or change

- I really enjoyed making this application because it gave me a better understanding of how to install and set dependencies up. Usually by working in a 'production environment', everything has been naturally installed and configured. This process was new to me.
- It was really fun to set aside time to work on this little side project with technologies I have been using for a while. It made me realise how much I like being a developer.
- I would of liked more time to implement and learn react as this is a technology I am extremely interested in using. However, I was forced to use JQuery & AJAX due to the time limitation.
- Switching over to RSpec would of been a better solution as this technology works much better with Capybara then minitest. It was quite hard to find the syntax for minitest and there are many webpages and blogs about Rspec/Capybara.
- The AJAX request for rating correctly stores a rating in the database. I would of liked more time to give a list of ratings on the show page, and for the rating to be rendered by the stars in the index.
