##  What did I like / What would I like to include in the future or change

- I really enjoyed making this application because of it gave me a better understanding of how to set dependencies up. Usually by working in a 'production environment', everything has normally been naturally set-up and so this process was new to me.
- I would of liked more time to implement and learn react as this is a technology I am extremely interested in using. However, I was forced to use JQuery & AJAX due to the time limitation.
- Switching over to RSpec would of been a better solution as this technology works much better then Minitest. It was quite hard to find the syntax for minitest and there are many webpages and blogs about Rspec/Capybara.
